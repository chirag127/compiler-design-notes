        Symbol tables in c
    </h2>

    <p>
        The following example shows how to create a symbol table.

    </p>
    <h2>Data structure for symbols tables</h2>

    <p>Symbol tables are an important part of compiler design and are used to store information about variables,
        functions,
        and other symbols used in a program. Symbol tables are typically implemented using hash tables or binary search
        trees.</p>

    <p>A hash table is an efficient data structure for storing key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute a
        unique
        index for each key, and stores the associated value at that index. To look up a value, the hash function is used
        again to calculate the index of the key, which is then used to access the correct value in the table. Hash
        tables
        can be used for symbol tables because of their fast lookup time.</p>

    <p>Binary search trees are another type of data structure that can be used for symbol tables. A binary search tree
        is a
        tree-like structure with nodes that store key-value pairs. To look up a value, the key is used to traverse the
        tree
        and find the associated value. Binary search trees are slower than hash tables for lookups, but they provide an
        easy
        way to traverse and modify the contents of the table.</p>

    <p>Symbol tables are an important part of compiler design and are used to store information about variables,
        functions,
        and other symbols used in a program. Depending on the application, either a hash table or binary search tree can
        be
        used to implement the symbol table. Both data structures provide fast lookup times, but binary search trees
        offer
        additional flexibility.</p>
    <h2> representing scope information. Run-Time
        Administration: Implementation of simple stack allocation scheme</h2>

    <p>A symbol table is a data structure used by a compiler to store information about the program being compiled. It
        is
        used to store identifiers, such as variables and labels, as well as the locations in code where they are defined
        and
        used. The symbol table is also used to store the scope information for each identifier. Scope information is
        essential to understanding the context in which an identifier is used and can be used for type checking and code
        optimization.</p>

    <p>Scope information is used to determine the lexical extent of a declaration, which is the region of a program in
        which
        the declaration is visible. In a compiler, the scope of a declaration is usually limited to the block in which
        the
        declaration is made. For example, a variable declared within a loop will only be visible inside the loop, and a
        variable declared in a function will only be visible inside that function.</p>

    <p>When implementing a simple stack allocation scheme, the symbol table is used to store the scope information for
        each
        identifier. Each time the compiler enters a new block or scope, it adds a new entry to the symbol table. The
        entry
        contains the information about the identifiers in the current block, such as the type, size, and location in
        memory.
        When the compiler leaves the block, the entry is removed from the symbol table.</p>

    <p>The symbol table is also used to store the scope information for each identifier. This information is used to
        determine the extent of a declaration, which is the region of a program in which the declaration is visible.
        This
        allows the compiler to ensure that an identifier is only used in its intended scope, and can be used for type
        checking and code optimization.</p>

    <p>In summary, the symbol table is used to store the scope information for each identifier when implementing a
        simple
        stack allocation scheme. This information is used to determine the extent of a declaration, which is the region
        of a
        program in which the declaration is visible. This allows the compiler to ensure that an identifier is only used
        in
        its intended scope, and can be used for type checking and code optimization.</p>

    <h2> storage allocation in block
        structured language. Error Detection & Recovery: Lexical Phase errors</h2>

    <p>Storage allocation in a block-structured language is the process of assigning memory to variables and other data
        structures. The process is usually handled by a compiler, and the memory allocated is usually allocated on the
        stack
        or in the heap. In a block-structured language, there is a distinction between global and local data, and the
        compiler must determine how much memory to allocate to each type of data. </p>

    <p>When a variable is declared, the compiler needs to determine the size of the variable and allocate the correct
        amount
        of memory. Variables in a block-structured language are usually allocated on the stack. This means that when a
        variable is declared, the stack pointer is incremented by the amount of memory needed for the variable. When the
        variable goes out of scope, the stack pointer is decremented by the same amount.</p>

    <p>In addition to variables, the compiler must also allocate memory for other data structures such as arrays and
        objects. Arrays are usually allocated in the heap, which is a section of memory that is managed by the operating
        system. Objects are allocated in the heap as well, but they may also be allocated in the stack depending on the
        language. The compiler must also be able to track which objects are in use and which are not so that they can be
        properly freed when they are no longer needed.</p>

    <p>Error detection and recovery is an important part of the storage allocation process. In a block-structured
        language,
        the compiler must detect any errors that occur during the allocation process and attempt to recover from them.
        This
        includes detecting any memory leaks, which occur when memory that is allocated is not properly freed. The
        compiler
        must also detect any out of bounds errors, which occur when a variable is accessed outside of its allocated
        memory.
        Finally, the compiler must check for any type errors, which occur when a variable is of the wrong type.</p>

    <p>Symbol tables are an important part of compiler design, as they provide the compiler with information about the
        variables and data structures in a program. A symbol table is a data structure that contains information about
        each
        variable or data structure in the program, such as its type, size, and location. The compiler uses this
        information
        to determine which variables and data structures need to be allocated memory, and how much memory to allocate.
        In
        addition, the symbol table is used to detect any type errors, as the compiler can compare the type of the
        variable
        to the type stored in the symbol table.</p>

    <h2> syntactic phase errors
        semantic errors.</h2>

    <p>Syntax errors, also known as parse errors, occur when a program violates one or more of the syntax rules of a
        programming language. Syntax errors are detected by the compiler and are reported with a specific error message
        that
        can help the programmer identify and fix the underlying problem.</p>

    <p>Syntax errors can be caused by a variety of factors, such as incorrect spelling or a missing semi-colon. In
        compiler
        design, a symbol table is used to store information about all the symbols used in a program. The symbol table
        contains information such as the type and value of each symbol, as well as its scope and location in the source
        code. The symbol table is used by the compiler to check for syntax errors, as well as to resolve references to
        symbols in the program.</p>

    <p>Semantic errors, also known as logic errors, occur when the program produces an unexpected result due to
        incorrect
        logic. Semantic errors are not detected by the compiler and can be difficult for a programmer to identify and
        fix.
        Unlike syntax errors, semantic errors do not usually cause the program to terminate abruptly. Instead, the
        program
        may produce an incorrect result or may not produce any result at all.</p>

    <p>In compiler design, semantic errors are usually handled by the semantic analyzer. The semantic analyzer is used
        to
        check for errors in the program that cannot be detected by the syntax analyzer. This includes errors such as
        type
        mismatches, undeclared variables, and incorrect operator usage. The semantic analyzer can also use the symbol
        table
        to check for errors such as uninitialized variables or variables that have been declared multiple times.</p>
